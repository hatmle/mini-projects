# Classify Song Genres from Audio Data
Rock or rap? Apply machine learning methods in Python to classify songs into genres.

# Description
Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock) to train a classifier to distinguish between 
the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). 
- Use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for 
obvious trends or factors. 
- Use the scikit-learn package to create a good model and classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. 
- Compare different methods such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth.
