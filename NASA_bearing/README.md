- Acoustics and Vibration Database <br>
Data source: http://data-acoustics.com/measurements/bearing-faults/bearing-4/

- Description: <br>
Three sets of data each consisting of four bearings were run to failure under constant load and running conditions. The vibration measurement signals are provided for the datasets over the lifetime of the bearings until failure. Failure occurred after 100 million cycles with a crack in the outer race.

Approach: <br>
- Machine learning (PCA)
- Artificial neutral network (AutoEncoder)

Objective: Anomaly detection
