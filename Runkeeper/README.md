# Analyze Your Runkeeper Fitness Data
Import, clean, and analyze seven years worth of training data tracked on the Runkeeper app.

With the explosion in fitness tracker popularity, runners all of the world are collecting data with gadgets (smartphones, watches, 
etc.) to keep themselves motivated. They look for answers to questions like:
- How fast, long, and intense was my run today?
- Have I succeeded with my training goals?
- Am I progressing?
- What were my best achievements?
- How do I perform compared to others?

The data (seven years worth of the training data from Runkeeper) is a CSV file where each row is a single training activity. 

This project lets you apply the skills from pandas Foundations and Visualizing Time Series Data in Python.
